## Fei Protocol Governance Subgraph

This subgraph indexes and exposes in GraphQL all the event data related to the GovernorAlpha and Tribe contracts from Fei Protocol, providing an easy access to Token holder and Delegates information, Proposals and votes casted, and all the relationships between those entities.

A live version of this subgraph can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/timg512372/fei-protocol-subgraph).

This repo is forked from the Compound Governance subgraph [here](https://github.com/arr00/compound-governance-subgraph).
